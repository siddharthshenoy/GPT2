# GPT2
Trying to understand how gpt 2 works its inner layers and experimenting on it

try training the model for atleast 1000 epochs colab would be enough for this but you can also try on local machine

# gTTS 
Have also tried to implement this its basically google text to speech

# Note
- If you are able to find a really good coding dataset then you can actually make this model type complicated codes for you .
- GPT-2 was one termed as " AI TO DANGEROUS TO RELEASE " cause of how much one could do with it
