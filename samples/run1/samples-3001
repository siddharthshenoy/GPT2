======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Well, you shall tell us for sure,
He that shall take you now has seen no gown.

SICINIUS:
You shall,
If he which now hath parted with you wish.

MENENIUS:
True, I beseech you, do not frown.

SICINIUS:
Let us therefore to our city.

MENENIUS:
We stay to serve the people.

SICINIUS:
We did desire you to resolve these differences.

MENENIUS:
Right; I desire you dismiss us.

MENENIUS:
Beator, I do not like your poltro.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, be content.

VOLUMNIA:
First o' the morning, then; I am up all a-doing.

MENENIUS:
Fie, you mistake; I had sworn I should
if I had speak to you, I should not have spoken.
Pray now, a word: we come upon you like men;
And, I think, you have heard us lay claim to Rome.

MENENIUS:
We have found the opposite; and, to have you answered,
We have generally been tyrannous. Our power was
great; but our suit was weak: we could not last
longer, and the people being whined forth,
often after our officers had been slain.
Your Menenius, then, was a worthy Roman;
But when you have deposed a traitor,
Let them not forget you had been consul.

VOLUMNIA:
I have forgot most of that which I haverieve to know;
But the Volsces are left in common cry,
And in authority; and in a bare conspiracy
Heredia is beheaded.
Yet Menenius did forego all harm; forI had
With nothing to do with that case. His oath is no
more: though for the people he is ever
loyal his oath is broke and made false;
And for the law he is ever precise
In what he decrees with above signified speed.
And now for us both--
The people's charge, Coriolanus, is
I die for Rome; and for law he is exact
In what he hath decreed with above signified speed.

CORIOLANUS:
It shall be so
I do not fear it: but I will end the matter
As expedient as ever I could.

VOLUMNIA:
How! so you contend, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
We do it not to make you grumbling in the common air,
But rather to put some measure of lamentation
Between us that would rejoice in the repeal.

VOLUMNIA:
O sir, you do us double wrong,--
Your repeal shall not be long; our best friends, Rome,
Prevent it.

CORIOLANUS:
Keep your oaths, and perform some ceremony.

VOLUMNIA:
I will not upon request perform such a function.

CORIOLANUS:
O noble man,--

VOLUMNIA:
Do you so?

VOLUMNIA:
If you do, sir, then within three days shall
I be trained to it. Then it follows
I shall be appointed a general.

CORIOLANUS:
Your nature's prince is well disposed;
And in you-pleasure you may be pleased.
I think, if we may put your nature on,
We shall soon have enough of him.

MENENIUS:
Let him be brought to your vantage.

VOLUMNIA:
He's in our services, and we shall serve him well.
How now, my steed! what, have you done?

CORIOLANUS:
Had you a glass of wine a day, I think 'twill be on again.
Have you forgot the Volsces, having no cause
To make you jocundity with the Volsces?

MENENIUS:
Have I not told you?
You have indeed lost your way; and with the addition
Of rigor and boldness you'll do yourself
Might well learn. Have you heard of Marcius?

CORIOLANUS:
I know not who he is, but that he wears a yew
coffin or a tassel-bush. He was, I think,
A Roman of excellent use, being of late
A corse and a fairly well-to-mastian;
Having hazel eyes and cour
