US.

CLIFFORD:
That's the first you shall see as well as
how I'll colour my armour. There's none to do
with boots.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, I have faith and honour in you, therefore proceed
with caution.

Provost:
'Tis not my place to be.
This way you have said you will colour your armour,
and now you have put on your boots, what may
but be the colour of your face.

CLIFFORD:
My beard! your beard!

Provost:
Your beard, it is my Lord.

GLOUCESTER:
And who wears it?

Provost:
The beggar.

CLIFFORD:
It is he, and he is out of stock.

GLOUCESTER:
Where is the stock?

Provost:
Here in Coventry; where, it seems,
the discontented prince our brother hath stolen from.
The messenger is coming to us; and we
will deliver him.

CLIFFORD:
I'll deliver him to you; for my country
is at your service.

CLIFFORD:
My lord, we must, in all likelihood, have you kill'd
for our false-faced greeting.

GLOUCESTER:
Who did this on our behalf?

Provost:
Yours, my lord.

CLIFFORD:
And we shall beat them to it.

GLOUCESTER:
Provost!

Provost:
What must we do?

CLIFFORD:
Help, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Help, help! A plague of beggars!
I'll bear them hence to the king.
They shall not know where they are.

Provost:
But if they do, I'll give them myself.
But, God forbid, I'll be wither'd;
and if I be not, it may prove
very swift.

CLIFFORD:
What trouble shall I have with beggars!
And what the devil's displeasure is?

Provost:
The want of them.

GLOUCESTER:
God help you, my lord.
God save you! Provost, I have great pains.
If I do not, we will make peace with beggars,
And, if they do, with their brains too.

CLIFFORD:
No, to no increase of any like kind,
To any person or thing.

GLOUCESTER:
I had rather live in peace than in war,
Because peace with beggars is sweet when they steal,
And war with beggars is bitter when they kill,
Because beggars feed on their masters' hatred
And will not buy their hatred by love.

Provost:
But if you will but cut off their ears,
You shall lose more than what you are.

CLIFFORD:
I'll go with them, I pray you.

Provost:
For that I can speak, I'll tear them with daggers.

GLOUCESTER:
Provost, let me kiss your hand; I do beg yours.

CLIFFORD:
O, mercy!

GLOUCESTER:
You must not say it was for your country,
But that it was for you and yours.
But wherefore speak you, Lord?

Provost:
For all the world beggars would sing; but they
are not to be singled out that way:
All beggars.

GLOUCESTER:
And you, Lord Provost, cannot make the world without war.
Have you any friends against the king?

CLIFFORD:
No.

GLOUCESTER:
But they not to be singled out that way,
But that they were all your kinsmen?

CLIFFORD:
No.

GLOUCESTER:
Why then, do not you speak, Lord?

Provost:
For the king, I see, and hear, and know.

GLOUCESTER:
And so will you by reason not to be talked withal;
For, for all your fellowship, what is left,
Is nothing but hate, hatred of the king.
But let it be, and not fear, for you are as like men.

GLOUCESTER:
Then I will chase after King Edward, and I
Will not stay until he has sold his body;
But if I do, I'll not stay till he has
Sold his soul. Then tell me
