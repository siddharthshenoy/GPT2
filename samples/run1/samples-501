 drives all these men in my ears,
And to see what it must be done,
Either they go down to the field alone,
Or by accident go to meet us.

HORTENSIO:
Away, away!

First Servant:
Taken but a few hours ago, the two tribesmen gone,
Which fought with fire, fell both together,
And both the king and the king died.

Second Servant:
We were both a part, the queen with the meek,
And that for our wounds we have received.

First Servant:
I am sorry in the ears of all,
'Tis no thing to look down on the world.

Second Servant:
You have done our wounds; and have had my heart:
We have but little else to do, other than lament.

First Servant:
We thank you, and have very few faults to do.

Second Servant:
'Tis but that I have my heart:
And so I am thankful to my heart that I did speak.

First Servant:
We thank each other, and thank this land,
That since I did speak, I have made you glad,
That, at a price, you are well repaid.

Second Servant:
You have made a very kind people proud,--not by my
disgusts or faults--yet, by that which you have done,
that I have made you all proud, to make me proud.

First Servant:
You have done your own country a wrong
as I have done the other, and are very sorry.

Second Servant:
Why, I will not pardon you, nor give you life,
To do with them as they are. You have done your duty,
And so to make to be more like yourselves;
For, as I did, you have done a cause,
That is your doing, to be revenged upon
You, but not by you doing your duty, in doing yourself.

First Servant:
I did repent in the ears of the fathers!
If you remember our duty, and say that you will
make up your mind to pardon us, you shall
mourn as we do, that we are forgiven; and
Your pardon is a grace which makes our part a
great body of grace.

Second Servant:
What grace! what grace!

First Servant:
What the devil!
O, there's more grace in a body of grace!
O, that is a body of grace! O, no, that is not;
No grace! no grace! O, a body of grace!

Second Servant:
O, there's more grace in a body of grace!
O, a body of grace! O, a body of grace!
O, a body of grace! O, a body of grace! O, a body of grace!
O, a body of grace! A soul of grace! O good o' God!
A soul of grace! O good o' God!
An immortal body of grace! O God!
For my part, and for a foul deed, and a worse,
'Not a poor creature, but a foul one,
And an a-weber, and a beast,
And a foul and a-dangerous, and a foul,
For it is a body of grace. O, an I'll do! O good God!
An immortal soul of grace! O God!
For my part, and for a foul deed, and a worse,
'Not a poor creature, but a foul one,
And an a-weber, and a beast, and a dog,
And a foul and a-dangerous, and a foul,
For it is a body of grace.

Second Servant:
O, the devil!

First Servant:
God save me!

Second Servant:
God save me!

Third Servant:
How now!

First Servant:
How now! why do you stay so,
While so much is now done?

Second Servant:
How now! why stay so, while so much is now done?

Third Servant:
How now! why stay so, while so much is now done?


First Servant:
Wherefore?

Third Servant:
Wherefore?

First Servant:
Wherefore, wherefore?

Third Servant:
Wherefore, wherefore?

First Servant:
Wherefore, wherefore, or wherefore!
Or wherefore, wherefore!

Third Servant:
Wherefore, wherefore?

First Servant:
