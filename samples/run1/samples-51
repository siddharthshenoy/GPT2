======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 man a little girl that looks pretty girl when she is a child, not looking for a horse, that she has never seen but a woman, and not a man.

DUKE:
That she may say to her,
O thou good Lord, that she may say to her,
The wise, I mean it, of the holy man.
What thou dost not know is a man that looks fair to a lady.
He that thou,
O Lord, know my name with,
But thou mayst know my daughter's name.<|endoftext|>What has happened? I came this way because I was a little young
And my father did not want me; but I was too young for thee.
And thou art my father: so be it.

RICHARD:
I'll have thee to the house: this man is the old man
That hath left me to this home; and he shall take my father out.

RICHARD:
A man I have never met in thee, my father.

RICHARD:
A man I once met in thee again; my father hath
To my word of my love: thou shalt be my father
That may have my love.

RICHARD:
A little child thou lovest
Like my own: thou lovest not, not even
Where thou was thy friend: thou art not a person, but a house.

RICHARD:
The good sir, I am thou'st and in my love.

RICHARD:
Is that not thyself, madam of the night,
In thy love my father? What's thy love, madam?

RICHARD:
That is not mine, madam, my love.

RICHARD:
And now my affectionate daughter I leave thee
To keep me from here, and to comfort thee
To make thee the kind, gentle, and warmest child that ever I see.
When my love comes thy mother, which is the same woman:
I am sure you would have been thy dear, gentlewoman,
So good, soft, and gracious as thy love, that thou canst have,
To give thee thy life-dough, thy life-enjoying womb;
And, if thou art thy mother, that thou loveest no less
Than I am, then thou lovest not thou.

RICHARD:
A little time.

RICHARD:
As I am the way I am: thou wast my loving, gentle lady,
And so as gentle as thou does thy love,
Which thy father's blood and the love thou lovest hath;
And thou art the most gentle, gentle and sweetest,
As thou hast thy little heart like thy mother and the love thou;
And thou hast thy little heart like thy mother and the love thou;
And thou art my loving, gentle, loving lady for thy loves
And thou hast thy little heart like thy mother,
And thou art a gentle mother like thy father's blood and the love thou;
And thou art full love like thy father's blood and the love thou;
And thou art full love like thy mother's blood and the love thou.

RICHARDS:
Ay, my darling, what, what!

RICHARD:
Hark!

RICHARD:
A woman,
I shall never forget thy son, thou that be my darling!

RICHARD:
Come upon me, to me, my love.

RICHARD:
Ay, sweet sir!

RICHARD:
An eye for a child, a eye for a woman;
For my love I wouldst love thee not as a father,
But as a happy mother, as a loving one.

RICHARD:
Ay, how I hate thee!

RICH:
Ay, sweet sir!

RICHARD:
Ay, how my love have thee to such an unnatural woman!
I know thy love, my love, in thy heart! My love, my love, my love,
As little children in thy love, as my children in thy tears!
But, my love, my love!
O, what of me!
But is thy love more my love than thy father's blood!

RICHARD:
Ay, sweet sir!

RICHARD:
A man I have never met in thee; my good wife!
O, what is thy love? O, what have I? O, my love! O! my love.
This is my son: thou thy father, my gracious cousin!
And thy loving mother! thou my loving mother! thou my loving mother!
I am so sweet.

RICHARD:
Ay, to me! your
