======== SAMPLE 1 ========
I come on well.

MAMILLIUS:
You are well met, my good lord.

Officer:
Good lords, give me your free leave.

WARWICK:
I am so sorry for my haste in arriving your gentlemen.

OXFORD:
O, pity their pity! Why do you wring your hands?

CLARENCE:
Pray God, lords, have you all at once brought your suits
To an end.

WARWICK:
I have all at once.

OXFORD:
Now come to think what 'shall' means.

CLARENCE:
I have already laid the gentlemen to death; but one, sir,
That title, my title, my life upon pain of death,
That I cannot move to make my best issue of flesh,
Which misery with begging will oblivion.
If the best begin to perish, so shall men's
atures do the heavy.

WARWICK:
Come, bring the suit.

OXFORD:
Your highness' time and place.

KING RICHARD II:
What of your suit?

WARWICK:
Think you oversooth the suit; go with him to death.

KING RICHARD II:
The suit is discharged, my lord,
And with ready money amends made.

OXFORD:
Bring it hither to our court.

WARWICK:
Think you, my lords, of that degree.

KING RICHARD II:
You shall know 'tis hap, when thou dost see it not
Where one of thy cousins lives.

WARWICK:
Tranio, then will thine eyes
Seeking unsuspected friends,
That o'erween to flame, discover and
Unbench this secret meaning behind
My covertive love! then show thyself
Like modest Balthasar in a silver
Set at gilding, thus to sopho another's surfeit;
For over whose fortunes most are made,
We all are underbearing, seeing as we are
Making strange accommodations in presence:
Pray, avoid, seek, seek, for thou hast
A suit for me, this usurp'd, thy not,
From whence offended, try thee not.

KING RICHARD II:
I tell thee, my lords, this is strange:
If this be a true suit,--for so it must be,--
Where is the man that did usurp the place
And shake all the windows in that place,
Inflict constant stomachers, shut all doors,
From sixteen to six seven awaked, my fair
Before and attentive to thy counsels,
Awaked all the plantminds, created all
The foaming spleen of my most patient,
Feeling me, were I any thing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke?

KING RICHARD II:
There's in cold parish; comfort: take him in peace.

DUKE OF YORK:
You prove too humane, for who but he is
Of such necessary goodness,--

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, well, I am no physic; that's no physic.

DUCHESS:
My liege, peace! at once have at it aloud.

KING RICHARD II:
My liege, what? I am painted as if
'Twas your changeling grace, to your choler,
Were a liquid; and that the devil makes love
Whiskey, white and blunt as crystal. My liege,
My horse, my father; all in all yours are
The very stars that look unto death. Death, O earth,
Great MAMILLIUS! We lie! And yet live we die!

DUCHESS:
What, death, MAMILLIUS! O heavens!
O miserable space, what mischance doth lie
In that inconstant orb o' the earth? This dark presence
Hath this orb circled madly in the east,
Looking grimly on the far side, with such a face
That all the ministers of heaven shall tremble,
Deposing one another, this orb, this earth,
Than all the branches of your great tree,
That carries your sap towards this fire, this earth,
Which, in all its glory, is a giant's head,
Which, being but an egg by the yoke,
Is so great that you need must needs bear
A perfectly round body. But thou art too base,
Which, being a base, is like a hard cockerel
When you break it; too high a
