======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 lord
The provost hath sent, to-morrow,
The head of the prisoner, and all the rest,
And tells them, I am come to take him from him
For all the world over, why stay we now?
Our counsel comes not, 'God keep your people safe!

First Senator:
My lord, we thought to stay until the porter
Dabbled in: our reasons for that departure
Were, we know, now growing stronger.

Second Senator:
My lord, a word; it are not of your blood
That bears the title of 'God's man.'

First Senator:
My lord, I am guilty of that title,
Which in the course of your office yielded,
By you and your wife's false accusation,
To take him from him; for from that time
I heard testimony before your highness' council,
That you yourselves twice, with all the army aboard,
Brought the head of the enemy
Unto the palmers; and for my sovereign's name,
Which had long been your sworn book,
I now confess my guilt; for then I must bail
Your highness; if not for worldly ends,
For this your fault stands to us right.

First Senator:
My noble lord,
What is the time that I must be away from me?

Second Senator:
Two days hence have we until the queen comes;
Then to-morrow will we to our palace.

First Senator:
My lord, I'll visit those that are within;
And make known to them all, as I said,
What comfort I have from you in you: I will bid them
Give me their hand and yours; to which I proceed,
As in a good business, get out of the way,
And give place to the idle hours,
Which never till now I have endued.

CAMILLO:
Good morrow, lord.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now, good Romeo, what dost thou here?

ROMEO:
This, my lord, that will teach me awhile to love:
This is love's note: give it me awhile to sing,
And take it up again with a new tune.

CAMILLO:
Well done, good Romeo; but what is the mind here?

ROMEO:
Good, this is my meditation; but not to read.

CAMILLO:
Come hither, goodly lady; she is not home:
Do not stay.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, fair pray, let's hear; the queen is come;
Go in: she shall not be long behind:
A piece of music o' the peace here hangs not
Above the sad tune of the sea's whistle,
Nor of the earth sung by men;
Nor of the town nor government,
Not even her own, nor the nobility,
Unapt of her, her hopes shrunk to shreds,
Such grief as hath robb'd the earth and her lands,
Her very fabric.

ROMEO:
I pray thou tell'st me a tale, not an 'tis mine:
Hast thou read anon of Aufidius?

CAMILLO:
How tell'st thou, fair maid?

ROMEO:
Haste, hasty fool! O, now I tell it not!
By moon, she hath not sounded me as I told she;
Or else she seems quite lost for a while,
More than the obsequious moon her father,
Which once did wish she were; or if she be be spoken,
For I did but whisper it.

CAMILLO:
Thou liest.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Good Lady, when did you last see 's father?

CAMILLO:
A fortnight ago.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Why, then: and now I come
From Cominius, to the Roman senate
Where I do present myself, to the citizens
Do what's in your honour expected, you have done,
To try and fence the greater part of the people
In your great government.

CAMILLO:
I do confess that I saw them; a pretty fellow,
A kind of his, bidding farewell to anrieved friends:
He was making his way to the Capitol,
And there pick'd out a piece of wood
To make his passage through the citizens:
I think it was the Tarpeian citizens,
That pick'd out the senators' voices, to take
Some form from one another, to give the rest
An audible hush; whereon the commons,
Laughing at their own
