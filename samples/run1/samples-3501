======== SAMPLE 1 ========
:
The old man is violent, and will devour you
In his last hours.

FLORIZEL:
Look, sir, mark his face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
A match! 'tis fit he be convey'd
To virtuous Bohemia.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The more near you are to Bohemia,
The merrier will be the adventure.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, so; and therefore hence to England.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
And to England; and to yourself, your subjects,
And to your kindred. Here, my sovereign,
Will I turn the tables on you, those
That fiery-burning thoughts of mania
Which your sovereign doth pine away;
Convey me to your queen, where I can
Learn from me how to bless thy bed,
How to wash me from this intolerable wound,
How to dress me gently and sweetly,
How toknit me gently into a fine knot
That grows not curst, nor awl;
Nor heart-sore, not for a brace,
For such as without care wash themselves
With balms, household cleanses,
From household functions cleanses;
Lovefully painted with household flowers,
Begins with beauty, enriches with grief,
In beauty of her beauty let thy state
Be clouded with her virtues;
And bestEStreamam it with a virtuous eye
When it doth minister them with her eye,
And bestEStreamam it with a skillier soul
A virtuous mind with a greater ear
Leads with it to perform an instrument,
Or something specially moulded for that purpose,
Which for that sweet craft is dangerous
To minister well the humble and discreet.
So, now I leave you, my former subjects,
And leave you to my better wooers;
Himcraft myself to act their affairs,
And to my strong confirmation perform
Your lady's body at her nurse's cuckold age.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well; my sire and your king here:
So well brought to bear that the mind of man
Should at last think it would bear a man's face.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, I hither, by heaven, and holy liege,
How well I play the parts of him I have;
And more specially honour my brother,
Than most aptly I could combine
My grief and my purpose.

EXETER:
And more truly;
Grace to be a suitor to be both;
And purpose to be both such.

KING RICHARD II:
Now, by heaven,
How much more becomes my grief when I am alone.

EXETER:
By heaven, much more
That I'll do of hereafter.

KING RICHARD II:
Now, by my soul, I wot well what's like
Thou art alone; how it is together
May be possible to wail unto death,
And what not to dream of so taking it.

EXETER:
Abhorred servant, what wilt thou do?
Thou hast lost thy business, thy shop, thy house,
Thy city, thy place, thy allegiance, thy state.
Go thou away: what doth else pass
Between thee and my complaint?

KING RICHARD II:
Neglecting that which cannot brook vain tears,
O, belike, thou shalt keep what thou hast lost,
Which now thou shalt bring to bitter trial.

EXETER:
Heaven shield my sovereign stand!

KING RICHARD II:
My heart sinks when I hope to meet my king.

EXETER:
Even in hope; my seal is flayed.

KING RICHARD II:
What means that, and no farther likelihood?

EXETER:
 Heaven shield my father's face!

KING RICHARD II:
Now my soul fears the world:
'Tis better used by naught but fools' fears.

EXETER:
True, but ever my mortal necessities
PAGE their increase with my unstaid tongue.
My tongue is as poison to my heart as I;
The which it poisons shall poison my soul.
I would it were female or no more;
For those that I use would sear my lips
To noose upon the demesnes; for that I love
Would gladly become a suitor to the tune of thine.

FLORIZEL:
Can any such tune be had?

KING RICHARD II:
Think you as many as I?

FLORIZEL:
Six, my good king
